# monalisp
a lisp based language, which is design-hackable, elegant, data-hackable.


## Ideas
- Database language(BNF) would be included into lisp grammer tree as a part of monalisp.
- Any searchable data could be treasured as a list-based db object.
- The basic db operations could be implemented via lisp macros or lisp functions.
- The users can change the basic interface of db operations and extend them, they also can change the grammer of db feature.
