# monalisp
An elegant, design-hackable and data-hackable lisp language.


## Ideas
### DB feature (data-hackable)
- Database language would be included into lisp grammer tree as a part of monalisp.
- Any searchable data could be treasured as a list-based db object.
- The basic db operations could be implemented via lisp macros or lisp functions.
- The users can change the basic interface of db operations and extend them, they also can change the grammer of db feature.

### Easy-porting-parser
- based on standard libc, depentdent from os api.

### Minimal-footprint-parser
- monalisp parser can be easily integrated into embedded system without a file subsystem.
Those embedded systems need the database feature, but due to the limited footprint of hardware always without a text-based file subsystem.

### Anything-is-text (design-hackable)
- If anything could be implemented as text, it means the languaure would be as more elegant as possible for designing.
