## Introduction

Common Lisp provides a variety of special structures for organizing programs.

Some have to with flow-of-control(control structures), while others control access to 
variables(environment strutures).

Some of these features are implemented as special forms; others are implemented as macros,
which typically expand into complex program fragments expressed in terms of special forms
or other macros.
