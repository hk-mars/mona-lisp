# Introduction

Declarations are used to specify extra information about your program to the Lisp system.

Declarations are **completely optional**.


# Declaration Syntax

- special forms

```lisp
declare {decl-spec}*
```

A **declare** form is known as a declaration; normally it may occur in the special forms 
listed below:

- labels
- locally
- define-setf-method               
- defmacro  
- deftype                         
- defun    
- defsetf                    
- let                     
- let*                   
- macrolet 
- flet
- do                              
- do*                             
- do-all-symbols                  
- do-external-symbols
