## Good Cleanness
So experience suggests we should embrace dirtiness. 
Or at least some forms of it; in other ways, the best quick-and-dirty programs are usually quite clean. 
Which kind of dirtiness is bad and which is good? The best kind of quick and dirty programs seem to be ones 
that are mathematically elegant, but missing features-- and particularly features that are inessential 
but deemed necessary for propriety. Good cleanness is a response to constraints imposed by the problem. 
Bad cleanness is a response to constraints imposed from outside-- by regulations, or the expectations of 
powerful organizations.

I think these two types of cleanness are not merely separate, but in opposition to one another. 
"The rules," whatever they are, are usually determined by politics; 
you can only obey them at the expense of mathematical elegance. And vice versa.
