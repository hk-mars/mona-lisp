holiday time (Feb-2019)

## Feb-2019-to-2020

- Desgin monalisp
- Implement monalisp parser (lisping in this summer 6~9)

### Events

- June-15-2019-to-June-21-2019

hack lexer of parser

- June 14, 2019

hack parser

- June 9, 2019

hack parser

- two weeks, from August 1 2019 to August 13 2019

hack parser (syntax AST tree has been constructed and verified, a demo has been shown)

- two weeks util the end of August 2019

[**goals**]

@ hack the core parts of parser (show a demo)  **#1**

@ improve codes and warnings  **#2**

[**#1**]

@ implementing for the scope and extent

@ implementing for below features:

when + do

if + do

return + return-from

macro feature

cond

loop + as + in

loop + for + in

out + out-from

dolist


- Sep 2019

	call user's macro
	
	gc
	
	load several lisp files
	
	create the name list of the syntax object with const type as to reduce the use of 
	dynamical memory(pratical via the BNF file and the AST tree).
	
			
- 2019

	call user API in C (a demo)
	
	dolist
	support string object
		
	load more lisp codes and fix the bugs

	think deeply about the features
	 
	db object

	create/search/update db (a demo)
	
	UI layout design
	
	UI interaction design
	
	Upgrade the lisp codes (not including the firmware)
	
	a debugger
	
	a vm
	
	
## 2019
