 *
 * 1. A rule should be made by combining the elements of tokens and keywords.
 * 2. A rule defines the determined paths as solutions for a stentence of BNF syntax.

 * 4. A good rule system should include less elements and some redefinable elements.
 * 5. I think the rules of common lisp includes above advantages.
