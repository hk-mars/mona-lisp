### language spec 
I think a programming language should be mostly defined in itself. A language spec should be divided into two parts, a small core of operators that play the role of axioms, 
and the rest of the language, which, like theorems, are defined in terms of the axioms.

### editor

@__

e.g.:  quit monalisp

@ (q)


Consider below codes in editor of shell-terminal:

   **@** (eql "foo" "foo")

   **>** (eql "foo" "foo")

   \* (eql "foo" "foo")

I think "@" is more elegant than others, although ">" and "*" is good.


### design-hackable
Any ideas that make designing more easy to hack, try them in monalisp.
- layout design.
- interface design.
- architecture design.
- system design (complex systems)

...

Consider more deeply about this.
