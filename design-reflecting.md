### language spec 
I think a programming language should be mostly defined in itself. A language spec should be divided into two parts, a small core of operators that play the role of axioms, 
and the rest of the language, which, like theorems, are defined in terms of the axioms.

### terminal editor

@__

e.g.:  quit monalisp

@ (q)

@: is also good.


Consider below codes in editor of shell-terminal:

   **@** (eql "foo" "foo")

   **>** (eql "foo" "foo")

   \* (eql "foo" "foo")

I think "@" is more elegant than others, although ">" and "*" is good.
"@" and ">" all have a forward direction.


### design-hackable

Any ideas that make designing more easy to hack, try them in monalisp.
- layout design.
- interface design.
- architecture design.
- system design (complex systems)
- ...

Consider more deeply about this.



### less init-forms and more optional brief main-forms

Too many optional init-forms in the loop makes it is hard to program and the code is not brief and elegant.

### implement the core form of a common lisp form as a minimize prototype
