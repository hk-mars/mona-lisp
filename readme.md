# monalisp
An elegant, design-hackable and data-hackable lisp language.

## ideas
### db feature (data-hackable)
- Database language would be included into lisp grammer tree as a part of monalisp.
- Any searchable data could be treated as a list-based db object.
- The basic db operations could be implemented via lisp macros or lisp functions.
- The users can change the basic interface of db operations and extend them, they also can change the grammer of db feature.

### easy-porting-parser
- based on standard libc, depentdent from os api.

### minimal-footprint-parser
- monalisp parser can be easily integrated into embedded system without a file subsystem.
Those embedded systems need the database feature, but due to the limited footprint of hardware always without a text-based file subsystem.

### anything-is-text (design-hackable)
- If anything could be implemented as text, it means the language would be as more elegant as possible for designing.

### easy-creating-new-parser

### with-minimal-elegant-editor

### easy-creating-complex-ai-system

### common-lisp-standard-based

### a language for good programmers
- Target user: hackers.

### everything-is-object, everything-is-data, everything-is-db (design-and-data-hackable)
