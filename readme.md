# Mona-lisp
An elegant, design-hackable and data-hackable lisp language.

# Ideas
### within-db-feature (data-hackable)
- Database language would be included into lisp grammer tree as a part of monalisp.
- Any searchable data could be treated as a list-based db object.
- The basic db operations could be implemented via lisp macros or lisp functions.
- The users can change the basic interface of db operations and extend them, they also can change the grammer of db feature.

### easy-for-porting-parser
- based on standard libc, depentdent from os api.

### minimal-footprint-parser
- monalisp parser can be easily integrated into embedded system without a file subsystem.
Those embedded systems need the database feature, but due to the limited footprint of hardware always without a text-based file subsystem.

### anything-is-text (design-hackable)
- If anything could be implemented as text, it means the language should be as more elegant as possible for designing. 

### within-minimal-english-text-filesystem (data-hackable)

### easy-for-creating-new-parser

### within-minimal-elegant-useful-editor

### based-on-common-lisp

### for good hackers and good designers

### everything-is-object, everything-is-data, everything-is-db (design-and-data-hackable)

### easy-for-architecture-design

### easy-for-system-design

### easy-for-layout-design

### for-minimalism

### for-elegant-products

# Releases

### [mona-lisp v1.0](https://github.com/hk-mars/mona-lisp/releases/tag/v1.0)

I recommend you to use [Emacs editor](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for reading and coding. :-)

I would implement more features and release a stable version in the future, and God know that schedule. :-)

If you have the source codes of another baby lisp, please share it with me, thanks.

And if you want to join mona-lisp community and hack together, please let me know.
